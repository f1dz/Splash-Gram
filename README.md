## Before you go
Before you are running the app, you should sign up to get an API ACCESS KEY on https://unsplash.com/developers and then rename file ```build_config.example.gradle``` into ```build_config.gradle```.

Change ```ACCESS_KEY``` with yours and change ```YOUR_DB_SECRET``` as you wish to encrypt the database.
```gradle
android {
    defaultConfig {
        buildConfigField "String", "BASE_URL", "\"https://api.unsplash.com/\""
        buildConfigField "String", "CLIENT_ID", "\"ACCESS_KEY\""
        buildConfigField "String", "SECRET", "\"YOUR_DB_SECRET\""
    }
}
```
and then do build

## Unsplash API
For demo tier we only got 50 request per hour and then the metrics will be updated every 20 minutes.
